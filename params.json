  "body": "### Welcome to my Python Studies Page.\r\nI have created this project just to make my life easier when I am ~~screwing~~ studying/playing about with Python code on different machines, without having to manually export and import from one to the other each time.\r\n\r\nAnybody is welcome to use any of the files and programs on the repository, which will generally just be programs testing out something new I have just learned, or maybe seeing if Python can be used to solve a specific problem I have encountered.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFor the puposes of this project, I (@FallenVagrant) am the sole author and contributor.  Should anybody see better ways of doing something I've done in my programs and wish to share the love, feel free to let me know.  Any advice is always appreciated.",
